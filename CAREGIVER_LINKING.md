# Caregiver-Patient Linking System

## Overview

The S&S application now supports linking caregivers to multiple patients, allowing caregivers to access and manage all their linked patients' information from a centralized dashboard.

## Features

### For Caregivers

1. **Caregiver Dashboard** (`/caregiver-dashboard`)
   - View all linked patients in a grid layout
   - See patient statistics (number of linked patients, active alerts)
   - Quick access to patient information and actions
   - Unlink patients when needed

2. **Patient Management**
   - Link to new patients using patient IDs
   - View individual patient details
   - Access patient medical records (read-only)
   - View patient alerts and emergency notifications
   - Navigate to patient calendar and location data

3. **Navigation**
   - Dedicated "Dashboard" link in navbar for caregivers
   - "Link Patient" option to add new patients
   - Context-aware navigation showing when viewing as caregiver

### For Patients

1. **Patient ID Display**

   - Generate patient ID if not already created

2. **Caregiver Access**
   - Caregivers can view patient profiles, medical records, and alerts
   - Patients maintain control over their own data editing

## How to Use

### Linking a Patient to a Caregiver

1. **Patient Side:**
   - Patient logs in and goes to Profile page
   - Clicks "View Patient ID" to see their unique ID
   - Shares this ID with their caregiver

2. **Caregiver Side:**
   - Caregiver logs in and navigates to "Link Patient"
   - Enters the patient ID provided by the patient
   - Patient is now linked and appears in caregiver dashboard

### Accessing Patient Information

1. **From Dashboard:**
   - Caregiver clicks on any patient card
   - Views comprehensive patient overview
   - Accesses medical records, alerts, calendar, and location

2. **Direct Navigation:**
   - Use navbar links to access specific patient sections
   - All pages show context when viewing as caregiver

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

The system uses a many-to-many relationship through the `caregiverpatientlinks` table:

```sql
caregiverpatientlinks {
  link_id (Primary Key)
  caregiver_id (Foreign Key to caregivers)
  patient_id (Foreign Key to patients)
}
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/caregivers/my-patients?user_id={id}` - Get all patients linked to a caregiver
- `POST /api/caregivers/{id}/patients` - Link a patient to a caregiver
- `DELETE /api/caregivers/{id}/patients/{patientId}` - Unlink a patient from a caregiver
- `GET /api/patients/{id}` - Get patient details (with caregiver access control)

### Frontend Routes

- `/caregiver-dashboard` - Main caregiver dashboard
- `/patient/{id}` - Individual patient view

- `/patient/{id}/medical-records` - Patient medical records (caregiver view)
- `/patient/{id}/alerts` - Patient alerts (caregiver view)
- `/link-caregiver` - Link new patients

## Security & Permissions

- Caregivers can only view patients they are explicitly linked to
